The mātauranga Māori (MM) data, which is integral to our research, is held and facilitated by Patuharakeke (including authors J.Chetham and A.Carrington). This includes the knowledge and insights gained from the coastal taiao (environmental) monitoring unit that discovered the midden. As this data is of cultural significance, it is not publicly available but was used with the permission and guidance of Patuharakeke.
The archaeological data used in our study, including the anthropogenic deposits within dune stratigraphy and their radiocarbon dating, is also not publicly available due to its sensitive nature and the need to preserve the integrity of the sites.
The geomorphological data, including topographic data, historical aerial photographs, and satellite imagery, will be made publicly available. This data will be hosted on a GitHub repository, the link to which will be provided upon the publication of the manuscript. This will allow other researchers to validate our findings and potentially build upon our work in understanding coastal landscape development. Please note that any use of this data should be properly cited and acknowledged. 
We believe in open science and are committed to making our research as transparent and accessible as possible while respecting the cultural and archaeological sensitivities involved. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
